    "# Immunization\n",
    "The goal of **Immunization** is to protect a portfolio against the change in the interest rate. If we have an obligation of paying $F$ amount of money in $D$ years. Suppose that the prevailing interest is $r$. Then the YTM of a bond will be close to $r$. A zero coupon bond with face value $F$ and mature in $D$ years will serve the purpose. However, it is very common that there is no such a bond in the market. We may construct a portfolio of other bonds so that the present value of this portfolio will equal to the present value of the future payment. However, if the interest rate change, then our portfolio may not worth the same as the payment that we need to deliver. \n",

    "Then what we do is to construct a portfolio consisting of fixed income securities so that its present value matches with the present value of the future payment, its duration matches with $D$, which is the time we need to deliver the payment, or equivalently, the duration of the hypothetical zero-coupon bond which mature in $D$ years. In this case, if the interest rate change, then the present value of the future payment and the present value of our portfolio will have the same amount of change. "
