    "**Problem 5**: (Tree cut) Suppose that you have the opportunity to plant trees that later can be sold for lumber. This project requires an initial outlay of money in order to purchase and plant the seedlings. No other cash flow occurs until the trees are harvested. However, you have a choice as to when to harvest. If you harvest after 1 year, you get your return quickly; but if you wait, the trees will have additional growth and the revenue generated from the sale of the trees will be greater. Assume that the cash flow streams associated with these alternatives are:\n",

    "**Problem 12:**(Oil depletion allowance) A wealthy investor spends 1 million to drill and develop an oil well that has estimated reserves of 200,000 barrels. The well is to be operated over 5 years, producing the estimated quantities shown in the following table. It is estimated that the oil will be sold for 20 per barrel. The net income is also shown. \n",

    "A depletion allowance, for tax purposes, can be computed in either of two ways each year: 22\\% of gross revenue up to 50\\% of net income before such deduction (option 1), or the investment cost of the product, equal in this case to the unit cost of the reserves, 5 per barrel (option 2). The allowance is deducted from the net income to determine the taxable income. The investor is in the 45\\% tax bracket.\n",
