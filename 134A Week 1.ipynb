    "## Internal rate of return\n",
    "Usually, there are investments where we need to deposit an amount money first, and then receive money in the future. This corresponds to a cash flow $(x_0,x_1,\\ldots, x_n)$ with $x_0 < 0$, and all other $x_i \\geq 0$. The **Internal rate of return(IRR)** is a tool to analyze the actual interest paid by this investment. More precisely, the IRR is a number $r$ such that the present value corresponding to this cash flow is $0$. In other words, the cash flow corresponding to investment is the same as the cash flow generated by saving the money $x_0$ in the bank with interest rate $r$ (which has present value $0$). \n",
