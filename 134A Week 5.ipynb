    "**Theorem** \\\n",
    "We suppose that the interest rate evolve under the **expectation dynamics** (i.e. the spot rates of next year are given by the forward rates $s_1' = f_{1, 2},\\;s_2' = f_{1,3},\\ldots$), and the interest compounds annually. Then, a sum of money invested in the interest rate market for n years will grow by a factor of $(1+s_n)^n$, independent of the investment and reinvestment strategy as long as all funds are fully invested. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example** \\\n",
    "Suppose that the spot rates are $(0.1, 0.2)$. We consider an investment of 100 dollars in 2 years. One option is that we may purchase the 1-year certificate of deposit, and we will have 110 at year 1. By the expectation dynamic, the new spot rate for 1 year investment is $f_{1,2} = 1.2^2/1.1 - 1$. If we reinvest the 110 at this interest rate, we get $110 \\cdot (1.2^2/1.1) = 144$ at year 2. The other option is that we can purchase the 2-year certificate of deposit, and we will get $100 \\cdot 1.2^2 = 144$ at year 2. Those two investments provide the same return at the end of year 2. \n",

We may also define the discount factor $d_{j,k} = \\frac{1}{(1+f_{j, k})^{k-j}}$, which is the discount factor from time $k$ to time $j$.
