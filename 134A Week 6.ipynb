    "**Exercise 5.9** (Little Bear Oil) You have purchased a lease for the Little Bear Oil well. This well has initial reserves of 100 thousand barrels of oil. In any year you have three choices of how to operate the well: (a) you can not pump, in which case there is no operating cost and no change in oil reserves; (b) you can pump normally, in which case the operating cost is 50 thousand, and you will pump out 20% of what the reserves were at the beginning of the year; or (c) you can use enhanced pumping using water pressure, in which case the operating cost is 120 thousand, and you will pump out 36% of what the reserves were at the beginning of the year. The price of oil is $10 per barrel and the interest rate is 10%. Assume that both your operating costs and the oil revenues come at the beginning of the year (through advance sales). Your lease is for a period of 3 years."

    "(Complexico mine) The Complexico mine is for lease. This mine has been worked heavily and is approaching depletion. It is becoming increasingly difficult to extract rich ore. In fact, if x is the amount of gold remaining in the mine at the beginning of a year, the cost to extract $z < x$ ounces of gold in that year is $500z^2/x$. (Note that as x decreases, it becomes more difficult to obtain gold.)"
